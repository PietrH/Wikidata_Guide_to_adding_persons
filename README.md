# A quick guide on how to add persons to Wikidata

Welcome to Wikidata! 

Objects on wikidata have a label, a wikidata id, and a description, and optionally one or more aliases. The wikidata id is the unique identifier, and remains constant. All other values can change. The label is the name shown at the top of the page, and is useful for humans to know what the object is describing. For a person, this would be their name. The description is one line to elaborate on this, I like to stick to what the person is most known for for example: “Belgian Botanist”. The alias is used for alternative labels, abbreviations, or other names the person might be known under.
